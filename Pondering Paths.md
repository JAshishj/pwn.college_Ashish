**1.<ins>The root</ins>**:-
   The challenge asks us to get the flag by invoking the pwn program by using it's absolute path.

   **My flag** :-pwn.college{AUhJazBtOvY4jD7pVzGGS2eEEGK.QX4cTO0wCNxAzNzEzW}

   So, the challenge asked us to get the flag by invoking the pwn using it's absolute path hence, I opened the shell and enter the path /pwn to invoke the program and got the flag.
   ```bash
   BOOM!!!
   Here is your flag:
   pwn.college{AUhJazBtOvY4jD7pVzGGS2eEEGK.QX4cTO0wCNxAzNzEzW}
   ```

  I learned that there are 2 types of paths:- 1.absolute path and 2.relative path and that / is the root directory.I also learned how to invoke a program by using it's absolute path.
