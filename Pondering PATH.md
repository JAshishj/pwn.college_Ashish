# **1.<ins>The PATH variable</ins>**:-
   In this challenge, you will disrupt the operation of the `/challenge/run` program. This program will DELETE the flag file using the `rm` command. However, if it can't find the rm command, the flag will not be deleted, and the challenge will give it to you! Thus, you must make it so that /`challenge/run` also can't find the `rm` command!
