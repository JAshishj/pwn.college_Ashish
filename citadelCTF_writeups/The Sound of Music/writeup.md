ðŸ—¼OSINT pt2: citadweller had a newfound interest in tracking the music they last listened to and posting ratings of new albums on various online platforms.

The flag is hidden in these digital footprints across music platforms and split into three segments. You will need to find all three to uncover the complete code and move on to the next floor.


# **<ins>My solve</ins>**:-
  By reading the challenge description i understood that to get the flag i had to look through various music rating platforms hence i asked the llm `ChatGPT` to give me the famous music rating platforms to which it replied with various platforms like Last.fm, Discogs, RateYourMusic, AlbumOfTheYear.org, etc and then i opened the `Last.fm` as it was recommended first and searched for the user `citadweller` and got the profile where one part of the flag was present, then i opened the `Discogs` and searched for the same but did not get any result, then i went to `RateYourMusic` and searched for the same and got the profile where the second part of the flag was present and there was also the link to it's `spotify` profile, where the third part of the flag was present, hence i got the whole flag.

  I learned how to investigate the web to find what i am searching for efficiently.
