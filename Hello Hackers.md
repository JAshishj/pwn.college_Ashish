1. **Intro to the commands** :-
     The challenge asks us to enter the hello command in the shell to get the flag.

     My flag :- pwn.college{sx-8ZC15Stsq73B3AYwgptYt-E5.QX3YjM1wCNxAzNzEzW}
   
     Basically,the challange asked us to get the flag by entering the command hello in the shell so i opened the shell and entered the command.
     ```bash
      hello
      pwn.college{sx-8ZC15Stsq73B3AYwgptYt-E5.QX3YjM1wCNxAzNzEzW}
     ```
   
     I learned how to run basic commands in shell and that commands in linux is case sensitive.

2.**Intro to the arguments** :-
    The chalenge asks us to enter the hello command in the shell with a single argument of hackers to get the flag.

   **My flag** :-pwn.college{YSB3qxKUvhU1NP5cNaCBdBU7aeS.QX4YjM1wCNxAzNzEzW}
 
   Basically,the challange asked us to get the flag by entering the command hello along with a single argument hackers in the shell, so i opened the shell and entered the command.
   ```bash
   hello hackers
   pwn.college{YSB3qxKUvhU1NP5cNaCBdBU7aeS.QX4YjM1wCNxAzNzEzW}
