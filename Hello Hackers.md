1. Intro to the commands :-
    The challenge asks us to enter the hello command in the shell to get the flag.

    My flag :- pwn.college{sx-8ZC15Stsq73B3AYwgptYt-E5.QX3YjM1wCNxAzNzEzW}

   Basically,the challange asked us to get the key by entering the command hello in the shell so i opened the shell and entered the command.
   '''bash
    hello
    pwn.college{sx-8ZC15Stsq73B3AYwgptYt-E5.QX3YjM1wCNxAzNzEzW}
   '''

   I learned how to run basic commands in shell and that commands in linux is case sensitive.
