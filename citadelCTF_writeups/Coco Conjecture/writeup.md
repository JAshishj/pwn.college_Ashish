The door to the next floor is guarded by a figure who calls herself "The Dragon CEO". She does not speak of mercy or choice, only of order and efficiency.

To enter the next chamber, you must complete the task presented by her. Complete it exactly as instructed, achieving operational efficiency by her standards, and the path forward will open.
